# Play-Bad-Apple-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-Nokia-5110

This is a sample for using Raspberry Pi to play videos a Nokia 5110 display. (Take "Bad Apple" as example, you can generate your own videos and play them by the matlab file I provided.)

For setting up the Nodia 5110 Display, you can refer here: https://learn.adafruit.com/nokia-5110-3310-lcd-python-library/usage

The theory is quite simple, the python code generally read and display images frame by frame, no high tech accociated, and very easy to understand.
